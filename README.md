# Notes App

## Introduction
This app was created with the intention to make a simple CRUD system oriented around user-defined notes. As of right now, the app is mostly complete with all the standard and expected functionality for a user needs, but as times progresses, features will improve and increment in size. All the code is elegantly refactored to the best of my ability to allow for a clean and conscise reading experience of each source file along with relevant JUnit 5 testing functions.
