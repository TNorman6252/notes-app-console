# Notes App

## Introduction
This app was created with the intention to make a simple CRUD system oriented around user-defined notes. As of right now, it's very barebones with limited functionality
but as times progresses, features will improve and increment in size. All the code is elegantly refactored to the best of my ability to allow for a clean and conscise reading
experience of each source file.

## What's Included 
- Add Note
- List Notes
- Update Note
- Delete Note
- Exit Note App

**All of these features are currently incomplete with exiting the app being the exception at this current stage in development.**
